# German tensor rubber - Hard sponge version
# Known for: direct feel, high speed, good spin on hard contact

# Contact properties - harder sponge = more direct energy transfer
restitution: 0.93
friction_static: 0.88
friction_dynamic: 0.72

# Hertzian contact model - stiffer due to hard sponge
stiffness: 52000.0
damping: 0.06

# Spin characteristics - needs more force to engage
spin_transfer_rate: 0.82
spin_reversal_factor: 0.55
